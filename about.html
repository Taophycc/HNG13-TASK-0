          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Taofeek Kassim, a passionate software engineer with a
            deep interest in building scalable systems and contributing to
            open-source projects. My journey into technology started with a
            curiosity about how things work behind the scenes, which eventually
            led me to pursue software development as a career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I've gained experience working with various
            technologies including React, Next.js, and backend systems using
            PostgreSQL and MySQL. I believe in continuous learning and staying
            updated with the latest trends in the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me watching The Big Bang Theory,
            reading technical articles, or exploring new programming concepts.
            I'm driven by a desire to create solutions that make a difference
            and help people solve real-world problems.
          </p>

          <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">
            Self-awareness is the first step to growth. Here are areas where I
            acknowledge I need to improve:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Advanced CSS Animations</h3>
              <p>
                While I'm comfortable with basic CSS, creating complex
                animations and transitions still requires more practice and
                experimentation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Testing and Test-Driven Development</h3>
              <p>
                I understand the importance of testing, but I need to build more
                confidence in writing comprehensive test suites and following
                TDD practices.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
              <p>
                Identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks in web
                applications is an area where I want to develop deeper expertise.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>System Design</h3>
              <p>
                Designing scalable architectures for large-scale applications is
                something I'm still learning and want to improve significantly.

          <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
          <div class="note-card">
            <p>
              Dear Future Taofeek,
            </p>
            <p>
              As you read this, I hope you're looking back with pride at how far
              you've come. Remember this moment when you were excited about
              every new concept you learned, every bug you fixed, and every
              feature you built.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't forget the late nights spent debugging, the satisfaction of
              finally understanding a complex concept, and the joy of seeing
              your code come to life. These experiences shaped you into the
              developer you are today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep pushing yourself to learn, but also remember to help others
              along their journey. The developer community thrives on
              collaboration and knowledge sharing. Be the mentor you wish you
              had.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stay curious, stay humble, and never stop building.
            </p>

        <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-extra">
          <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            The HNG Internship represents more than just a learning opportunity
            for me—it's a chance to prove to myself that I can compete with the
            best and contribute meaningfully to challenging projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm particularly excited about the collaborative aspects of this
            program. Working alongside other talented developers will expose me
            to different perspectives, coding styles, and problem-solving
            approaches that I might not have encountered otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing I've learned in my journey so far is that consistency
            beats intensity. It's better to code for an hour every day than to
            cram for twelve hours once a week. I'm committed to maintaining this
            discipline throughout the program.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also believe in the power of documentation and sharing knowledge.
            Throughout this internship, I plan to document my learnings, share
            my experiences, and contribute to the community by helping others
            who might be facing similar challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I want to acknowledge that imposter syndrome is real, and
            it's something many developers face. But I've learned to use it as
            fuel rather than letting it hold me back. Every challenge is an
            opportunity to grow, and every mistake is a lesson in disguise.
